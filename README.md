Project Work

For this project I worked on developing an intelligent agent using reinforcement learning to solve a maze style problem known as the Treasure Hunt Game. I was given a base code structure that defined the maze environment, basic movement logic, and the framework for integrating a neural network model. My task was to complete and refine the Q learning algorithm that allowed the agent to learn from its environment through trial and error. I created code for the model architecture, the training loop (qtrain()), and the logic for the agent’s exploration and reward system. I also implemented adjustments such as epsilon decay, experience replay, and reward shaping to improve learning performance. I learned how artificial intelligence can be built to adapt dynamically based on feedback rather than being explicitly programmed with rules.

Connection to Computer Science

This course helped me see how reinforcement learning fits within the larger field of computer science. Computer scientists design and build systems that can process information, learn from data, and solve problems efficiently. What makes this work matter is that it powers the technology driving modern life from healthcare analytics and cybersecurity to self driving vehicles and virtual assistants. The algorithms, data structures, and decision making frameworks developed by computer scientists form the foundation for innovation and progress across every industry.
Approaching a problem as a computer scientist means combining logical thinking, experimentation, and iteration. When building the reinforcement learning agent I couldn’t rely on a perfect solution from the start. I had to test small changes, observe their effects, and continually refine the algorithm. This mindset mirrors real world software engineering breaking down complex problems, hypothesizing solutions, testing results, and optimizing performance. I learned to balance theory with practical debugging and discovered how computational thinking turns abstract concepts into working systems.

Ethical Responsibilities

This course also deepened my understanding of the ethical responsibilities that come with designing intelligent systems. I am responsible for ensuring that AI models and algorithms operate fairly, respect privacy, and avoid unintended harm. Ethical considerations included ensuring that the agent’s behavior aligned with clear goals and that outcomes could be explained and adjusted if they became unpredictable. In professional environments these responsibilities extend to protecting user data, preventing bias in machine learning, and maintaining transparency about how systems make decisions.
As computer scientists our work affects people’s lives in direct and indirect ways. The systems we build must be trustworthy, secure, and respectful of user autonomy. I will apply these principles by incorporating ethical design practices, testing for bias, and keeping the user’s well being as a priority in any system I help create. This course showed me that technical skill and ethical awareness are equally important in computer science,true innovation happens when both are balanced.
